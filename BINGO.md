## Definitions
**“Bingo Lotto Jackpot”** - Bingo Lotto's highest win level, which is added to the **full game** win in case the full game winning pattern appears before going over the **Jackpot limit**.<br>

**"Jackpot limit"** - number of numbers to be drawn to win the jackpot is initially 41. In the event that there is no winner at the jackpot winning level in a particular draw, the jackpot limit number increases by one number in the next draw (i.e. the limit in the following draw will be 41+1, in the subsequent draw 42+1, etc.) and thus the jackpot limit increases until the jackpot winner(s) is determined. The draw after winning, the jackpot limit will reset to 41.

## Game
### Game combination
<p>The player places a bet on a game combination consisting of 25 numbers. The numbers are placed on a 5 x 5 grid in such a way that there is one number in each square. The arrangement of numbers in the columns of the ticket grid is as follows:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>Column</td>
            <th>B</th>
            <th>I</th>
            <th>N</th>
            <th>G</th>
            <th>O</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
     <td>Numbers in the range</td>
     <td>1-15</td>
     <td>16-30</td>
     <td>31-45</td>
     <td>46-60</td>
     <td>61-75</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Winning patterns
<p>Winning numbers are drawn from the numbers set until at least one game combination participating in the draw fills the entire ticket grid (i.e. all 25 numbers of the game combination have been drawn). The draw is then terminated regardless of the number of balls drawn.</p>

<p>The winner is the player whose playing combination includes at least one of the following winning symbols:</p>
